# Welcome to the Skynet TodoList!

Welcome!

In this repo you will find a simple Skynet todo list style application.

The app allows you to add and delete your todo items. The application data will be stored in the SkyDB.
You can always retrieve this data with your MySky account. 

While using this app, don't forget to save the changes each time before moving to different folder.

##### Improvements to be made:
1) Add the function to add new folder
2) Connect created myskylink to hns
